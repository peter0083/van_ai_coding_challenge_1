# Image Classification Workshop

**Meeting Date: 02-09-2018**

**Attendees: Akshi, Johannes, Xinbin**

## General Responsibilities

### Write Setup Instructions

**Responsible Person: Akshi**

### Ask Siraj about Dean roles for Akshi and Xinbin

**Responsible Person: Johannes**

### Share School of AI material with Akshi and Xinbin

**Responsible Person: Johannes**

### Ask Daving Laing about Live Question Forum used in MDS

**Responsible Person: Johannes**

#### Notes

* Akshi, check out my `balanced_data` repo's `README` for setup instructions that I will be using for that workshop. It might be useful.

## General Notes

* Python scripts to be imported into Notebook

* Tensorboard to be explained

* We will be using Jupyter Notebook (and will later decide whether we want to export it to Codelab, but probably not)

## Workshop Outline and Responsibilities

### Intro to School of AI

**Responsible Person: Johannes**

**Estimated Duration: 15 mins**

### Intro to Image Classification

**Responsible Person: Akshi**

**Estimated Duration: 15 mins**

### Model Training / Retraining

**Responsible Person: Xinbin**

**Estimated Duration: 15 mins**

#### Notes

* All attendees to image same image dataset

* Hyperparameters to be constant

* Explain pretrained architechture

* Explain transfer learning (how general image features are being used)

* Give a simplified explanation of the bottleneck layer and softmamx. Can talk about how it relates to probabilities and how the class with the highest probability is most likely the correct class.

### Tensorboard

**Responsible Person: Johannes**

**Estimated Duration: 10 mins**

### Predictions using Trained Model

**Responsible Person: Akshi**

**Estimated Duration: 15 mins**

#### Notes

* Use ~3 image examples (2 good, 1 ambiguous)

* Talk about interpreting the class probabilities.

### Hyperparameter Tuning (Optional)

**Responsible Person: Xinbin**

**Estimated Duration: TBD**

### Using Different Image Dataset (Optional)

**Responsible Person: Akshi**

**Estimated Duration: TBD**

### Conclusion

**Responsible Person: Johannes**

**Estimated Duration: 15 mins**

#### Notes

* Talk about coding challenge

* Give a taster for the theory to be covered in the next meetup
