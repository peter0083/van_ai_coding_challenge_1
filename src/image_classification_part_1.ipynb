This penultimate layer has been trained to output a set of values that's good enough for the classifier to use to distinguish between all the classes it's been asked to recognize.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because every image is reused multiple times during training and calculating each bottleneck takes a significant amount of time, it speeds things up to cache these bottleneck values on disk so they don't have to be repeatedly recalculated. The command you ran saves these files to the `bottlenecks/` directory. If you rerun the script, they'll be reused, so you don't have to wait for this part again.\n",

    "- **validation accuracy** : the precision on a randomly-selected group of images different from the training.\n",
    "    - **Overfitting** : model may overfit to the noise during training, so we use **validation accuracy** to measure the true performance. If the train accuracy is high but the validation accuracy remains low, that means the network is overfitting and remembering noise\n",
